## Introduction
CIRCLE is a framework for large-scale scene completion and geometric refinement based on local implicit signed distance function. Please refer to our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12905) for more details.

## Implementations

We now provide implementation based on Pytorch and we will soon provide jittor version which is faster for training.
Please refer to the corresponding folders `jittor/` and `pytorch/` for specific build and running instructions.
